<h1> Reducing Pollution:</h1>
<p>Smart devices can be installed by local governments and councils to provide real time insight into the number of pollutants in the air. This can allow the local authorities to analyse this critical environmental data to make decisions to prevent global warming. These devices and data will have the ability to create cleaner city by authorities making informed data decisions â€“ not only creating a smart city using technology to tackle climate change, but also a greener city.
