<h1> Social Benefits </h1>
<p>Imagine a city which is safer, commuting with less congestion, quicker disaster response times and having  healthcare in your control through remote monitoring. Technology integrated into your city could make this happen, creating a smart city with a variety of social benefits.

<h1> Transport:</h1>
<p> A variety of devices such as cameras, cameras, sensors and GPs provide live data on information such as travel times and speeds. This continuous flow of data enables real life monitoring. Allowing for congestion, accidents and distributions on the road to be identified and managed effectively such as adjusting traffic light timings.</p>

<h1> How does it work?</h1>
<p> Smart cities like Barcelona use a sensor system to help drivers find parking spaces. It works by sensors being placed under parking spots to detect if the spot is available. This data is then processed and communicated to drivers who are guided to the spots through digital signs. This simple system requires a lot of technical applications, working in real time with AI based software to send and sort the data. Once the data is processed it sent through the cloud to driver's devices and digital road signs. </p>

<h1>Benefits: </h1>
<p>Smart traffic management control shortens commuting times and creates a smoother journey for all road users by using real time data and responsive planning. By reducing congestion, smart traffic solutions reduce air pollution as engines will not be running unnecessarily for long periods of time.</p>

<h1>Health:</h1>
<p>Remote healthcare will become a key feature of a Smart City. Wearable devices will be able to track health movements such as heart rate in real time. These devices will automatically alert healthcare centres about unusual or irregular activities and take action, without the patient having to do anything. Smart healthcare will detect issues early and reduce the need for frequent in-patient visits and reduce healthcare costs in the long run. </p>

<h1> Security:</h1>
<p>Using video analytics, cities will become safer by applying surveillance cameras around the city to detect crowd and traffic congestion, violent and suspicious behaviours. These cameras will be able to detect people, objects, vehicles and licence plates and will be connected to appropriate emergency services such as the police.</p>
</div>

<div class="security">
<img src="images/how.png" alt="infographic">
<h1> How Does it Work?:</h1>
<p> These cameras use AI powered video analytics, computer vision and IoT connectivity to monitor and manage behaviours within the city. The edge AI processing within the cameras allow for easy detection of objects where the data processed and sent to cloud-based platforms to be able to alert law enforcement, emergency services and traffic control. </p>

<h1> Personal Data: </h1>
<p>The data being generated and used by the surveillance cameras must comply with the main principles of data regulations protecting personal data such as GDPR. </p>
